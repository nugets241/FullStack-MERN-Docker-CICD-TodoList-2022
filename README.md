# Final Project for Web Software Development Fall 2022
This is a simple full stack project for a TAMK Web Software Development course. I have created a simple ToDo-list that let's you add and delete items
in a way that's simple for you and also mark items as completed.

## Why?
Though the project exists as a necessity for a course, it is by no means my only motivation. I am and was interested to see what I can do with all the knowledge I have gained so far and put it to the test by creating a good quality website with good error handling.

## What is it? How does it work?
What I have here is a simple browser based ToDo-list app. It allows you to list your current to do -tasks, mark them as done, remove them if needed. Easy to use and handy to have in your phone or computer if you like ticking items of a list!

## Server address and endpoints
